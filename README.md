# My Semi Functional Toolbox V 0.4.4
I hope it helps junior functional programmers/javerscripters - this is not a traditional library and I have chose to not use module import. That may change.
This is built on the shoulders of giants massive shoutout to MDN, I started trying to keep all these functions as pure as possible but am not remaking _lowdash.
 I also want to thank **Lukaz Ruebbekle** for making the clarity of his talks and taking the time to give this a once over. I only started unit testing as this became a 25kb project, let alone a learning tool even if just for myself 
sections with comments have likely been tested for functionality.

## Conributing
While I call this mine it is fully open source and I invite people to write the functional sections in their own words.

This starts with a dot and continues to the apex of my understanding of functions. As such it will recurse on. The functors aren't the point.
If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough so please jump from section to section pinching what you will. Afterall, 
these are well recognised patterns that started as holes in punchcard! What I would really like to see is forks with other people explaining
these patterns in their own words.

## ChangeLog: 

* 16/06/23 *

- Updated the README (this file)
- Added the changelog with the previous version revision 
- Merged the Matrix and X.Dimensional array functions
- Very Minor Edit to the To Do section
- Added the AI section

* 14/06/2023 *

- Capitalised "contributing"
- Shortened optimised and removed as much code as I could manage this session
- Added (more) primitive checkers

## To Do(and expand on)
- Spellcheck 
- Add your ideas, and thoughts in comments. Play with the lego **ala Functional Programming part 2, see what works together, make your monads, do module export, add types. Bend this to your will
- I am looking to blog about micro-optimisattions so if you can think of a method **add it
- Keep up to date with the latest **ES(X)** functionality
- **BENCHMARK**

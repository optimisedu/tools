# My Semi Functional Toolbox V 0.1.1.1.1
Welcome to the mess that is my mind, I hope it helps you - this is not a traditional library and I have chose to not use module import. That may change.
This is built on the shoulders of giants massive shoutout to MDN, I started trying to keep all these functions as pure as possible but am not remaking _lowdash.
 I also want to thank **Lukaz Ruebbekle** for making the clarity of his talks and taking the time to give this a once over. I only started unit testing as this became a 25kb project, let alone a learning tool even if just for myself 
sections with comments have likely been tested for functionality.

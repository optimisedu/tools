//Welcome to the mess that is my mind, I hope it helps you - this is not a traditional library and I have chose to not use module import. That may change.
//This is built on the shoulders of giants massive shoutout to MDN, I started trying to keep all these functions as pure as possible but am not remaking _lowdash.
//I also want to thank Lukaz Ruebbekle for making the clarity of his talks and taking the time to give this a once over. I only started unit testing as this became a
//large project - sections with comments have likely been tested for functionality. Speed tests are coming.
//Potentially this could be used as a teaching resource after a lot of cleaning. If anybody wants input it would be appreciated.
(there are a fair few functions in the toolbox to format this MD)
This is completely open source please use at your displeasure and suggest improvements

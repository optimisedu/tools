# My Semi Functional Toolbox V 0.1.1.1.1
Welcome to the mess that is my mind, I hope it helps you - this is not a traditional library and I have chose to not use module import. That may change.
This is built on the shoulders of giants massive shoutout to MDN, I started trying to keep all these functions as pure as possible but am not remaking _lowdash.
 I also want to thank **Lukaz Ruebbekle** for making the clarity of his talks and taking the time to give this a once over. I only started unit testing as this became a 25kb project, let alone a learning tool even if just for myself 
sections with comments have likely been tested for functionality. Speed tests and benchmarking of different methods are coming. At the moment there are four sections on functions but I haven't even spellchecked
This is completely open source please use at your displeasure and suggest improvements

# My Semi Functional Toolbox V 0.1.1.1.1
Welcome to the mess that is my mind, I hope it helps you - this is not a traditional library and I have chose to not use module import. That may change.
This is built on the shoulders of giants massive shoutout to MDN, I started trying to keep all these functions as pure as possible but am not remaking _lowdash.
 I also want to thank **Lukaz Ruebbekle** for making the clarity of his talks and taking the time to give this a once over. I only started unit testing as this became a 25kb project, let alone a learning tool even if just for myself 
sections with comments have likely been tested for functionality.

# contributing
While I call this mine it is fully open source and I invite people to write the functional sections in their own words.

*TODO*
- spellcheck 
- Add your ideas, and thoughts in comments. Play with the lego **ala Functional Programming part 2, see what works together, make your monads, do module export, add types. Bend this to your will
- I am looking to blog about micro-optimisattions so if you can think of a method **add it
